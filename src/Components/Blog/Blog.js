                </h2>
                <p>node.JS and Javascript both of these are used for programming. But there is a significant difference between Node.JS and Javascript. JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language that is object-oriented. It is used for developing HTML pages that are dynamic and have various interactive effects on their web pages. The Node.JS, on the other hand, helps in representing a list of all the methods and objects that the JavaScript code can access when run via node interpreters or in the V8 engine.

                <p>
                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.

                <p>
                JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization
